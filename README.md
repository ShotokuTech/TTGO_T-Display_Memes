# TTGO_T-Display_Memes
TTGO T-Display Bringing Old Memes Back to Life. 

It's been a while since I made this TTGO T-Display Convert Images for Your Own Custom Display video. I just got a comment from a friend of the channel asking about what code I used. It took me a moment to retrace my steps. But I figured that it was a modified version of the old sketch that the T-Display shipped with called ttgo-t-display.ino. It is now called Factory Test. I talk about this in Bricked TTGO T-Display Fixed With New Firmware and Factory Test Sketch.
Our friend also mentions another sketch TFT_Flashjpg. 
It seems like a good idea. But there is a conflict with the type of variable used in the online image converter and this sketch. So let's revive old memes using the TTGO T-Display.
